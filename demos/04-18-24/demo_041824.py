    #Programming activity 2
    #Using list comprehensions, do the following:
    #Create a list from 0 up to and including 10000

    #Create a list that squares all the numbers from the previous list

    #Create a list that only includes odd numbers from 0 up to and including 9877

    #Create a list that has converted each word in the following string to lowercase: "tHIs iS A sENtENce thaT hAS miXeD cASe"

    #Create a list that has called ord() on the characters in the example string 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogâ€™


    #Using a generator comprehension
    #Create a dict that maps all integers from 0 up to and including 10000 to their square roots


    #Sum the value of all even numbers from 0 up to and including 4578
