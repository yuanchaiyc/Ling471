# Computational Methods for Linguists

This course is forked from Olga Zamaraeva's [original repo](https://github.com/olzama/Ling471) and Matt Kelley's [updated repo](https://github.com/maetshju/Ling471) for the course, which was developed for the University of Washington Department of Linguistics in 2021.

More information will be added to this README as necessary. Please note that while you are free to read through the materials and assignments from the original offering of this course, the lectures and assignments will not be identical, so it may not be a big benefit for you to try to work ahead in that manner.
