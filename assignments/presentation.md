# Presentation

15% of your grade.

1. Choose a **peer-reviewed** data science project such that:
    1. ...it involves statistical analysis of language data
    2. ...you understand enough of it to clearly talk about what was done and why. (This does not mean that you need to understand everything!)

2. Prepare a 5-minute presentation. I recommend no more than 3-4 slides of content. If your slides are dense, then no more than 3.
    1. Present the project: when was it done, by whom, what's the title. **Include the citation** (this is a requirement!).
    2. Why is the project interesting or imporant?
    3. Summarize the approach. You do not need to get too technical. Clarity is key.
    4. What are social implications of deploying such technology? What should we be thinking about?

3. Either prerecord your presentation and upload to Canvas or come to class prepared to present your slides.

4. If presenting in class, collect feedback from instructors and peers. If prerecorded, start a discussion board thread **by May 31** and collect feedback there. 

5. Address the feedback (related to the slides: e.g. include the citation, add slide numbers, increase font, separate content into two less dense slides, etc.) and submit the updated slides to Canvas.
